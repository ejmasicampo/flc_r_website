<h3>Follow-up work</h3>
<p>Here I describe the follow-up work I did for Session 3 wherein I imported a data set using rio(), practiced creating visualisations of that data set with ggplot(), documented those efforts using R Markdown, and published that documentation to my Github website.</p>
<p>First, I loaded the tidyverse and rio packages for managing and importing data into R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(rio)</code></pre>
<p>Then I imported my data set. In this data set, I explore belief in harmless wrongs (i.e.Â the belief that certain behaviors are immoral even if they do not harm) in a sample of users of the website Amazon Mechanical Turk. I tested what proportion of people believe in harmless wrongs or, alternatively, believe that behaviors are only wrong insofar as they cause harm. I also askedpeople who belive in harmless wrongs to provide an example of a harmless wrong, and I measured various perceptions of those harmless wrongs (immoral participants thought those behvaiors were, how indicative those behaviors were of poor moral character, etc.)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>HarmlessWrongs &lt;- import(&quot;Study175bDatasav.sav&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>After importing the dataset, I checked the data set using the head() function.</p>

<p>I am interested in why people consider harmless wrongs to be immoral. If these behaviors cause no harm, then what is unethical about them?</p>
<p>In my data set, I asked people who believe in harmless wrongs to supply an example of a harmless wrong. I also asked these people to indicate precisely how immoral they considered that behavior to be (1 = not at all; 7 = very), and I asked people to rate the behavior on several other dimensions. One of those dimensions was the degree to which participants view the behavior as indicative of poor moral character (1 = not at all; 7 = very much so).</p>
<p>I am interested whether harmless wrongs are perceived as wrong because they are indicative of poor moral character. Therefore, I created a scatterplot of the relationship between perceptions of harmless wrongs as indicating poor moral character (on the X axis) and perceptions of harmless wrongs as immoral (on the Y axis). I used ggplotâs geom_point() geometry.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot (HarmlessWrongs, aes(x = HWpoorcharacter, y = HWHowImmoral)) + geom_point()</code></pre>
<p><img src="pre_work_files/figure-html/visualize-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>One limitation of the above visualization is that it does not depict the large numbers of participants with identical responses. Therefore, I created a second visualization using as my geometric object geom_co1 forunt().</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot (HarmlessWrongs, aes(x = HWpoorcharacter, y = HWHowImmoral)) + geom_count()</code></pre>
<p><img src="pre_work_files/figure-html/visualizewithgeomcount-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I also created a box plot visualization.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot (HarmlessWrongs, aes(x = factor(HWpoorcharacter), y = HWHowImmoral)) + geom_boxplot()</code></pre>
<p><img src="pre_work_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>And I created a violin plot visualization.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot (HarmlessWrongs, aes(x = factor(HWpoorcharacter), y = HWHowImmoral)) + geom_violin()</code></pre>
<p><img src="pre_work_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>

<h2>Session 4</h2>
<p>For my follow-up work to Session 4, I worked on the code for importing data directly from Qualtrics using the qualtRics package. I will be collecting data in Qualtrics over multiple time points and thus would like automate the process of downloading and analyzing those data as they come in.</p>
<p>First, I installed and loaded the qualtRics package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;)
remotes::install_github(&quot;ropensci/qualtRics&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(qualtRics)</code></pre>
<p>Then I registered my Qualtrics credentials. (I assigned my Qualtrics API token as the value of QualtricsAPIToken within .rprofile to keep it hidden here.) I also told R not to use the labels but rather to use values for survey responses.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>qualtrics_api_credentials(api_key = QualtricsAPIToken, 
                          base_url = &quot;wakeforest.ca1.qualtrics.com&quot;,
                          install = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Apparently then running this code reloads the environment to enable using the credentials without restarting R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>readRenviron(&quot;~/.Renviron&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I then imported the Harmless Wrongs data set directly from Qualtrics using the getSurvey() function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>HarmlessWrongsfromQualtrics &lt;- getSurvey(surveyID = &quot;SV_8IbGxs0unkqqERv&quot;, includeQuestionIds = c(&quot;HWHowImmoral&quot;, &quot;HWpoorcharacter&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

<p>I am now able to retrieve data directly from Qualtrics, which will be useful for my SOTL project this semester. I will be asking my students to complete Qualtrics surveys every other week for the entire semester. I hope to write some R code that will download, analyze, and create a report from those data and that I can (re)run at any point in the semester.</p>

<h2>Session 5</h2>
<p>Following session 5, I met with a statistics consultant to learn how to set up my data properly for using a multi-level model for analyzing my data. I am feeling good about having a proper, tidy format to work toward. I have also collected more data from my class. And now that I am ready to start combining spreadsheets into a single, master data frame to analyze, Iâm realizing one issue â I need to anonymize my data set. At each time point in my study, students are completing a Qualtrics survey in which they are entering their Wake Forest user names. I want to replace these user names with pseudo-randomly generated numbers that I can then use to link their responses across surveys. I am not sure yet of the best way to do this!</p>
